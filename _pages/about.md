I am a PhD candidate at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in the Operations Research and Engineering Management (OREM) department. My research primarily focuses on the foundations of optimization and machine learning. My work falls into the following categories.

* Algorithmic Foundations of Optimization and Machine Learning: Developing algorithms and conducting complexity analysis for various optimization problems, including constrained convex optimization, bilevel optimization, minimax games (Nash Equilibrium), and variational inequality (VI) problems with applications in machine learning. 
* Mathematical Modeling: Formulating and solving real-world problems, such as dynamic pricing policies in the electricity market, using machine learning methods.

I have published my research in top-tier venues such as the IEEE Transactions on Power Systems and ICML. I obtained my MSc at Sabanci University on the topic of statistical learning methods in decision-making problems in electricity markets. I did my BSc at AmirKabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).
